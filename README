This project is easily buildable (on Windows), with py2exe, http://www.py2exe.org/ .

All that needs doing is download the appropriate version from there and run
 'python setup.py py2exe --includes sip'
from the src directory and once all libraries are on your machine, in site-packages and whatnot, you should be all good.
